GAME DESCRIPTION: 
-----------------
Doctor Zomboss has sent a special horde of minions sporting new rides!
Indeed, these Zomboni warriors are not to be taken lightly!

Guide Crazy Dave from the bottom-right of the 6x6 game screen to the top row.
BE WARNED! Although Crazy Dave has special shoes made for walking on ice, some of the Zombonis are WICKED FAST!

RED Zombonis are angry and the FASTEST.
YELLOW Zombonis are a moderate speed.
GREEN Zombonis are slow and nearly blind.

Taco! TACO?
Of course!  Crazy Dave went all-out trying to get another crack at his taco in Plants vs Zombies 2.  A tear in the space-time continuum has allowed his taco to reappear at random along the game board for Crazy Dave to re-eat again and again!
